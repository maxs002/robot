<summary><h2>What is this 3D model design?</h2></summary> 
  
- This is my version of a vortex cannon, however, instead of releasing air, I want it to release small balls that I added.
- There is a hole in the center of the cannon because that's how a vortex cannon works, you need something similar to a bag to make it function.

- Just randomly thought of it, researched a bit, and modified to something I think can function.

<summary><h2>Do you plan on updating this model?</h2></summary>
  
- Yes, because this is just a concept. I am more than 80% sure it wouldn't work when printed, so I plan to keep researching and editing.
