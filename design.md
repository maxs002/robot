## What is this 3D model design?
-This is my version of a vortex cannon, however, instead of releasing air, I want it to release small balls that I added. There is a hole in the center of the cannon because that's how a vortex cannon works, you need something similar to a bag to make it function. 

## Why did I come up with this?
-Just randomly though of it, researched a bit, and modified to something I thought may function.

## Do you plan on updating this model?
-Yes, because this is just a concept. I am more than 80% sure it wouldn't work when printed, so I plan to keep researching and editing.
